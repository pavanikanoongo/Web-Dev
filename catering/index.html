        <h1>About Catering</h1>
        <h4>Traditions since 1985</h4>
        <p id="first">
          The earliest account of major services being catered in the United
          States was an event for William Howe of Philadelphia in 1778. The
          event served local foods that were a hit with the attendees, who
          eventually popularized catering as a career. The official industry
          began to be recognized around the 1820’s, with the caterers being
          disproportionately African-American.The catering business began to
          form around 1820, centered in Philadelphia.

          A catering service makes and provides food and drinks for gatherings
          such as parties, weddings and business events. The business will
          prepare a selection of refreshments — whether it’s hors d’oeuvres or a
          three-course meal — for the party’s guests. This menu is pre-approved
          by the person hiring the catering business.
